# Compiling from source
- Open the solution in Visual Studio (likely 2017+ only for now1)
- Build the solution in debug or release
- Download the official WTC wallet, extra it and put it inside a wallet folder:
bin -> Debug -> wallet
- Rename the walton.exe file in that wallet folder to wtcbackend.exe


This is so this wallet can run without affecting the official wtc wallet.
