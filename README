# Compiling from source
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio (likely 2017+ only for now1)
2. Build the solution in debug or release
3. Download the official WTC wallet, extra it and put it inside a wallet folder.

It should look like this: bin -> Debug -> wallet
4. Rename the walton.exe file in that wallet folder to wtcbackend.exe


I'll try get some automatic build steps in for this in the future. You can look at the release download for an example layout - it has the wallet folder already in it.
