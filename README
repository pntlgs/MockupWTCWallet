# Compiling from source
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio (likely 2017+ only for now)
2. Build the solution in debug or release
3. Download the official WTC wallet, extract it and put the contents inside a 'wallet' folder in the debug/release folder.

It should look like this: bin -> Debug -> wallet
4. Rename the 'walton.exe' file in that wallet folder to be 'wtcbackend.exe'


I'll try get some automatic build steps in for this in the future. You can look at the release download for an example file/folder layout - it has the wallet folder already setup.
